## Overview

This is the completed project provided by Frontend Mentor. The project involved building an interactive rating component which displayed a thank you card once the user selected a rating. I used a YouTube tutorial to guide me through it as I had difficulty accessing and manipulating the DOM elements. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

- Initially I created the ratings page and styled it following the guidence of a tutorial video. 
- Then I commented out all the HTML content for the rating page and created the HTML structure for the "thank you" card. 
- I then styled the Thank you card and commented out this HTML section. 
- Finally I created the JS file to program the rating component. I added the second part of the HTML to be entered into the DOM. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project as an opportunity to fill some of the gaps I have in terms of structuring styles and implementing DOM manipulation. I also learned a lot about the :before and :after CSS classes.

## Acknowledgments

I need to give credit to [ETHIO CODE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh70JL7ukKc). I got stuck early on in the project and I could not understand how to structure it to make it function correctly. Although, it was not in English the video is easy to follow. I recommend watching it if you get stuck.
